	Increases Productivity and Efficiency
Performance is increased, errors reduced, and automation is improved by well-designed software.
	Powers Everyday Life and Industry Growth
From smartphones and web applications to embedded systems in cars and medical devices, software engineering affects daily life.

2.	Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
	The Birth of Software engineering (1968)
The term Software Engineering was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to the Software Crisis
	The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s)
In the 1970s, structured programming became a dominant approach to software development.
	The Agile Revolution (2001)
Agile emphasized flexibility collaboration iterative development leaving away from rigid, document-heavy approaches like the waterfall model.

3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
	Planning – Define the project scope, objectives, feasibility, and resource requirements. This phase ensures that the project is viable and aligns with business goals.
	 Requirement Analysis – Gather and document software requirements from stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of what the system must accomplish.
	Design – Create architectural and detailed design specifications, including system architecture, database design, user interface layout, and data flow diagrams.
	Implementation (Coding) – Developers write code based on the design documents, following coding standards and best practices.
	 Testing – Validate the software through various tests (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix defects.
	Deployment – Release the software to the production environment, making it available to users. This may involve different deployment strategies like phased rollout or full release.
	 Maintenance and Support – Address bugs, update software with new features, and optimize performance over time to ensure continued functionality and security.


4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
